[00:48.74]I want every single piece of you
[00:53.04]I want your heaven and your oceans too
[00:57.87]Treat me soft but touch me cruel
[01:01.46]I want to teach you things you never knew
[01:05.57]Baby bring the floor up to my knees
[01:09.99]Let me fall into your gravity
[01:14.65]Then kiss me back to life to see
[01:18.23]
[01:18.92]Your body standing over me
